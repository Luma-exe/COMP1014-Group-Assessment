# Question 4

Test whether average sleep duration vary significantly across different genders.

# Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis H0 - All genders have the same average sleep duration.

Alternative Hypothesis H1 - At least one gender has a different average sleep duration.

```{r}
SleepCogStudy <- read.csv("Resources/Sleep_Cognition_Study_f1PhaXA.csv")
```

```{r}
sleepDurGender <- SleepCogStudy[SleepCogStudy$Gender %in% c("Male", "Female"), ]

t.test(AverageSleepDuration ~ Gender, data = sleepDurGender)
```

# Conclusion

As the p value is greater than 0.05 we prove the Null Hypothesis that all genders have the same average sleep duration.
